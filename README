Acme-ScripturaContinua

Acme::ScripturaContinua allows you to turn regular texts into something
economical and special while allowing you to do something for the environment.
Think of all the paper you can save simply by abandoning layout and
punctuation.

    use Acme::ScripturaContinua;

    my $scriptura = Acme::ScripturaContinua->new();
    my $text = 'Well you know my name is Simon.';
    print $scriptura->continuate( $text );
    
Returns the much more succinct: WELLYOUKNOWMYNAMEISSIMON
